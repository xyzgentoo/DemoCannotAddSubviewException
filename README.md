# DemoCannotAddSubviewException
Way to reproduce the "weird" exception - NSInvalidArgumentException, can't add self as subview.

This demo only shows one type of NSInvalidArgumentException. 

"Can't add self as subview." is a key description in the exception info. 

This one shows the callstack with UINavigationController stuff. That's the thing you need to pay attention to.

Engjoy!
